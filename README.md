# risk-free-selfish-mining
In our work, we implement a simulation program in Python based on the specification of the Polkadot to simulate our attacks. We analyze the impacts of our attacks by varying the fraction of validators controlled by the mining pool. We first present a theoretical analysis of the revenue gained by the mining pool (based on probabilistic analysis) and then show the simulation results. Our simulation shows that the simulation results roughly match our theoretical analysis. 
We put our simulation scripts, along with the simulation logs in this repository.
